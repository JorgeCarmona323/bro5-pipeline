# Research Notes - January 22, 2026

## Today's Focus
Initial project setup and literature review planning for macrocycle enumeration pipeline.

## Literature Reading

### Paper 1: Chemical Reaction Enumeration (ACS J. Chem. Inf. Model.)
**Link:** https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci200379p

**Reading Status:** 📖 Started - Will complete tonight

**Key Points to Look For:**
- [ ] Main methodology for reaction enumeration
- [ ] Reaction enumeration approach
- [ ] Handling of stereochemistry
- [ ] Application to peptide synthesis
- [ ] SMARTS patterns used
- [ ] Validation methods

**Initial Observations:**
_(Add notes while reading tonight)_

```
Your observations:
- Paper set the foundation for Reaction SMARTS standards
- N-acylation to amide reaction is EXACTLY what we need for peptide coupling
- No protection/deprotection steps included - authors claim it's unnecessary in silico
- Uses Daylight Reaction SMARTS language (same as we planned)
- Key reaction: Schotten-Baumann amide formation

Prominent reactions in paper:
- N-acylation to amide (1165 examples)
- N-arylation with Ar-X (458)
- Reductive amination (386)
- Suzuki coupling (338)
- N-sulfonylation (163)
- N-acylation to urea (155)
- Sonogashira (155)

Supporting files obtained:
- ci200379p_si_003.xls - CSV of all reactions (CRITICAL for tomorrow)
- ci200379p_si_002.pdf - Visual reaction schemes

Focus for our project:
- {Schotten-Baumann_amide} reaction from XLS file
- This is the amide coupling we need
- Will explore and extract exact SMARTS tomorrow
```

## Project Activities

### Completed Today ✅
- [x] Created enumeration project structure
- [x] Set up Git repository
- [x] Pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/JorgeCarmona323/Macrocycle_Enumeration
- [x] Organized research notes by date
- [x] Added first literature paper

### Technical Discussions
**Topic:** N-methylated amino acids in building blocks
- Identified `CN([C])C` pattern in building blocks
- Need to handle N-methyl peptide coupling differently
- DataWarrior idcode preserves more structural information than SMILES

**Topic:** Reaction SMARTS approach
- Decided to use Daylight Reaction SMARTS
- Need to export exact patterns from DataWarrior
- Will implement in RDKit using `AllChem.ReactionFromSmarts()`

## Questions & Next Steps

### Open Questions
1. What is the exact Reaction SMARTS from DataWarrior?
2. How are building block CSV files structured?
3. What are the column names in X1, X2, X3, X4 files?

### Tomorrow's Tasks
- [ ] Read and take detailed notes on ACS paper ✅ (Completed tonight)
- [ ] Document findings in tomorrow's research note
- [ ] Explore ci200379p_si_003.xls reaction database
- [ ] Extract {Schotten-Baumann_amide} SMARTS pattern
- [ ] Test SMARTS pattern with RDKit
- [ ] Export building block examples from DataWarrior
- [ ] Begin drafting enumeration script with amide coupling

## Code Development

### Created Today
- `enumerate_macrocycles.py` - Main enumeration framework
- Research organization structure
- Documentation templates

### Next Development Tasks
- Building block library loading
- Reaction SMARTS implementation
- Coupling function development

---

**End of Day Summary:**
Project initialized with proper structure. Repository live on GitHub. Ready for literature review and implementation planning.

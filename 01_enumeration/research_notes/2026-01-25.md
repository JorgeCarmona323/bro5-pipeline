# Research Notes - January 25, 2026

## Today's Focus
Testing enumeration notebook and planning next steps for building block preparation.

## Test Enumeration Notebook Status

**Status:** ✅ Test enumeration Jupyter notebook looks good

The test_enumeration.ipynb is working as expected and provides a good foundation for the macrocycle enumeration workflow.

## Next Steps

### Building Block Preparation
- **TODO:** Create deprotected CSV files for all building blocks (X1, X2, X3, X4)
  - Need to prepare CSV files with proper format:
    - `ID` or `Number`: Building block identifier
    - `SMILES` or `Structure`: SMILES string of the building block
  - Ensure all structures are in deprotected form suitable for enumeration

### Testing Schedule
- **Plan:** Rerun enumeration test next week with the actual CSV files
- **Timeline:** Week of February 1, 2026
- **Goal:** Validate full pipeline with real building block data

## Notes
- Current test uses placeholder/example data
- Production run will require all building block libraries to be properly formatted and deprotected

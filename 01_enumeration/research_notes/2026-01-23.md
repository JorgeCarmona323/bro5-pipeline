## Today's Focus
Complete literature review of ACS paper and document findings. Plan reaction implementation strategy.

## Literature Reading

### Paper 1: Chemical Reaction Enumeration - COMPLETED NOTES
**Link:** https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci200379p

**Reading Completed:** ✅ (Add time when finished)

**Detailed Notes:**

### Extracted Reaction: Schotten-Baumann Amide Formation

**Reaction Name:** `{Schotten-Baumann_amide}`

**SMIRKS Pattern:**
```
[C;$(C=O):1][OH1].[N;$(N[#6]);!$(N=*);!$([N-]);!$(N#*);!$([ND3]);!$([ND4]);!$(N[O,N]);!$(N[C,S]=[S,O,N]):2]>>[C:1][N+0:2]
```

**Reactants:**
- Reactant 1: Carboxylic acid with pattern `[C;$(C=O)][OH1]`
- Reactant 2: Primary or secondary amine (excluding tertiary, quaternary, N-oxides, hydrazines, etc.)

**Product:** Amide bond `[C:1][N+0:2]`

**Example:**
- Acetic acid (`CC(=O)O`) + Ethylamine (`NCC`) → N-ethylacetamide

**SMARTS Pattern Breakdown:**
- `[C;$(C=O):1]` - Carbon in carbonyl group (marked for atom mapping)
- `[OH1]` - Hydroxyl group (leaving group)
- `[N;$(N[#6])...]` - Nitrogen bonded to carbon with extensive exclusions:
  - Not double/triple bonded
  - Not charged
  - Not tertiary/quaternary
  - Not in N-oxides, hydrazines, or thioureas
- `>>[C:1][N+0:2]` - Forms neutral amide bond

**Key Takeaways for Our Project:**
```
1. This is the EXACT reaction we need for peptide coupling in macrocycle enumeration

2. No protection/deprotection steps needed (in silico advantage)

3. Pattern handles primary and secondary amines but excludes problematic functional groups

4. Direct implementation in RDKit using AllChem.ReactionFromSmarts()

5. Can be applied sequentially: X1+X2 → Int1, Int1+X3 → Int2, Int2+X4 → Macrocycle
```

**Action Items from Reading:**
- [x] Extract Schotten-Baumann amide SMIRKS from XLS file
- [x] Implement reaction in enumerate_macrocycles.py
- [ ] Test reaction with simple examples (acetic acid + ethylamine)
- [ ] Load building block libraries (X1, X2, X3, X4)
- [ ] Implement sequential coupling logic
